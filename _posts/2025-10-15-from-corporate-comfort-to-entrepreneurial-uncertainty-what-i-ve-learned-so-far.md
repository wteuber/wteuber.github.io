Are you thinking about leaving a stable job to build something meaningful? If so, you’re not alone - and you’re not crazy. I recently made the leap from corporate life to starting a business that helps conscious consumers discover high-quality, hand-crafted goods. It’s been exhilarating, terrifying, and most of all eye-opening.

**Why should you care?** Because if you’re considering a similar path, or even just a big change, the emotional rollercoaster is real. Here’s what I wish I’d known before I started, and what might help you on your own journey.


## The Emotional Cycle of Change: More Than a Buzzword

We all love the idea of transformation, but the reality is messy. The “Emotional Cycle of Change” isn’t just a diagram. It’s a lived experience. Here’s how it plays out for me:

* **Uninformed Optimism:** The honeymoon phase - and honestly, that’s where I am right now. Everything seems possible. I’m full of ideas and energy, riding the initial wave of excitement.
* **Informed Pessimism:** Reality sets in. The to-do list grows, and doubts creep in. Am I really cut out for this?
* **Valley of Despair:** The hardest part. Progress feels slow, and quitting seems tempting. This is where most people give up.
* **Informed Optimism:** Small wins start to appear. I will need to learn from mistakes and see a path forward.
* **Success:** Not there yet - but I now know it’s a process, not a moment.

If you’re in the Valley of Despair, you’re not failing - you’re learning. That’s where growth happens.

## The 5 Fundamentals: What Actually Matters

There’s endless advice out there, but these five fundamentals have made the biggest difference for me:

**1. Value Creation:** What real problem are you solving? For me, it’s helping people find products that align with their values, not just their needs.

**2. Marketing:** How will people discover you? I’ve learned that authentic storytelling and community engagement beat big ad budgets - especially early on.

**3. Sales:** Turning interest into revenue is harder than it looks. I’m experimenting with different approaches, from direct outreach to partnerships, to see what resonates.

**4. Value Delivery:** Can you consistently deliver what you promise? I’m building systems to ensure every customer feels valued, not just sold to.

**5. Finance:** Track every Euro. Cash flow is king, and small leaks can sink big dreams.

## My Hard-Won Lesson

The biggest trap? Confusing “planning” with “doing.” Right now, I’m still in the very early stages - doing my homework on how to register a business and figuring out what it takes to start selling effectively. I haven’t sold a single product yet. I’ve spent weeks perfecting spreadsheets, pitch decks, and the company logo, but I know that nothing will teach me more than talking to real customers and shipping real products - even if imperfectly, when the time comes.

**If you’re on this path, act before you feel ready. You’ll learn faster, and your audience will appreciate your honesty.**
